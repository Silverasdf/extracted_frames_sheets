**Important Considerations:**

*   **Assumptions:** I've assumed that a T-bone accident, based on this one frame, has a high possibility of injury and need for police intervention to investigate.
*   **"Likely" for Police:** Accidents often require police presence for documentation, insurance purposes, and determining fault.

Please note that this is based on a single frame and might not be a complete or entirely accurate depiction of the situation.
